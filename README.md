Supervise Machine Learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn on input data that has been labeled for a particular output.

The key characteristic is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from. That includes the "right answers" or the correct label y for a given input x. The algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and try to produce the appropriate corresponding output y.

Supervised learning algorithms primarily generate two kinds of results: classification and regression.
