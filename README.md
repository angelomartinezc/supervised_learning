# supervised_learning


Supervise Machine Learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings.

The key characteristic is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from. That includes the "right answers" or the correct label y for a given input x. The algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a prediction.
